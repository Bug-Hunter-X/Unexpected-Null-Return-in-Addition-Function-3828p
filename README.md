This repository contains a simple JavaScript program that showcases a common coding error involving null values and how to address it. The `bug.js` file demonstrates the initial buggy code that returns null if either input is null. The solution, in `bugSolution.js`, offers an improved version that handles null values more robustly. This is a good example to demonstrate a subtle error in handling null values and promotes best practices in JavaScript programming.
